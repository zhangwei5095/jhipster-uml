Welcome to JHipster-UML!

This project's main goal is to bring support of UML (more precisely, XMI) files (from various editors) to JHipster so that it can read the files, without you answering the questions.

You'll be able to create your entities by supplying a UML file (made with your favorite editor, if it supports XMI) to JHipster, and we'll take care of creating your entities for you!

We support: Modelio, UML Designer and GenMyModel.
Moreover, we can convert your XMI file to a JDL one, so that you can use it with [JDL Studio](https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-studio)!

For more information, visit our [Wiki page](https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/) in JHipster's wiki.

**Pretty important note**: v2.0.0 (the next release) will **only** support JHipster v3.0+. The versions before v2.0.0 will still support anterior versions of JHipster.
**Thank you**.
